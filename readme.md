- Countrywise finding the top 10 countries which has the most number of cases
- Finding countries that has highest death rate
- Datewise spread of confirmed cases and death cases were plotted
- Spread of COVID cases on top countries are done
- Visuals are done in PowerBI
- The consistency of confriremd cases and death cases were found and created a visual based on that
- Based on Gender and age-group, charts are drawn

Prediction
- Predictions are done for both confirmed cases and death case
- Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models are used to fit tha model
- Results:
  - Decision Tree and Random Forest gave better predictions
  - Specifically Decision Tree gave nice results
- Based on the predictions, plots are made datewise

Visualisation
- The affected countires are plotted in a map to get a overview of the world using folium
